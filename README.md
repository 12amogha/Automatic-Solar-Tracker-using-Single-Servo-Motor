# Automatic-Solar-Tracker-using-Single-Servo-Motor

LDRs are used as the main light sensors. Single servo motor is fixed to the structure that holds the solar panel. The program for Arduino is uploaded to the microcontroller.
The working of the project is as follows :
LDRs senses the amount of sunlight falling on them. Two LDRs are divided into left and right. 
For east, west tracking, the analog values from left LDRs and right LDRs are compared and if the left of LDRs receive more light, the servo will move in that direction.
If the right LDRs receive more light, the servo moves in that direction.
The purpose of this project is to increase the efficiency of the solar energy absorbed by the solar panels.
